For a list of files to download, you can create a ZIP file with all of the selected downloads, instead of having to download each one individually.

== Description ==
If you have a page with a list of files to download, now you can offer your users the chance to create a ZIP file with all of the selected downloads, instead of having to right-click and download each one.
Activate the plugin, and insert the \"Download All\" shortcode to get it up and running. The plugin will take care of the rest!

== Installation ==
Activate the plugin.

On the page with the downloads, insert the [zipItUpMenu] shortcode.
Any anchor tag that points to one of the downloads in the link MUST be given a CSS class of \"download-link\"
The plugin will monitor the \"download-link\" CSS class, and make them clickable without automatically navigating to the link, allowing the user to create the list of items to download in a ZIP.

*This plugin requires the ZipArchive PHP. Most hosting providers can turn it on for you.
